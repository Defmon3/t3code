# AUR packaging

This directory maintains the [`t3code-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/t3code-bin) and
[`t3code-nightly-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/t3code-nightly-bin) packages. Both
repackage the official x86_64 AppImage from GitHub Releases.

## Publishing

Run the packaging command locally after publishing the release assets. It selects the stable or
nightly package, updates its version and checksums, builds it, regenerates `.SRCINFO`, and pushes
it to the AUR. Never run this build through GitHub Actions.

To validate a release on Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu --needed base-devel github-cli jq namcap
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) RELEASE_TAG=v0.0.33 \
  packaging/aur/scripts/release.sh
```
